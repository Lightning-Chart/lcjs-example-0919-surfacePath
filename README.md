# JavaScript 3D Surface Path Projection 2D

![JavaScript 3D Surface Path Projection 2D](surfacePath-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Simple example of custom user interaction in a 3D surface chart.

The application tracks user interactions to the 3D surface data.
After user has clicked on two locations along the surface, the application highlights the path between those 3D points along the surface.

The same data is also displayed in a 2D chart below.
